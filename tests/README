                         TEST MODULES
                         ============


To add a test module you only have to add a directory with c++ files.
The CMakeLists.txt will be generated automatically.

The new test will then have the name of its directory.

If you want to install data, you can simply add a data dir in the new
test. This data directory will be installed to:

${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/engineTests/<test Name>


You can also have a config.in.hpp . This file will be automatically
detected.

If should need extra CMake stuff, put it in a custom.cmake.


If you totaly dislike the automatically generated CMakeLists.txt
you only need to add a MANUAL_CMAKE file.
