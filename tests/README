                         TEST MODULES
                         ============


To add a test module you only have to add a directory with c++ files.
The CMakeLists.txt will be generated automatically.

The new test will then have the name of its directory.

If you want to install data, you can simply add a data dir in the new
test. This data directory will be installed to:

${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/engineTests/<test Name>

You should also add the <test Name> in the testOrder.txt. This file makes
sure that the tests are generated in the right order.


You can also have a config.in.hpp . This file will be automatically
detected.

If you need extra CMake stuff, put it in a custom.cmake.
